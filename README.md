# pyCovidVisualizer
A python script that allows you to see the number of infections in your country and plots the results on a graph.

## SSL

You need import ssl (Secure Sockets Layer)too reason being that your app might not work if you doing, because your connection might not be secure and the csv file that we're reading from needs a secure connection.

## Changes that can be applied

The matplotlib allows us to plot graphs based on data that we recieve, so its really up to you which country you want to put in the code. Just go to line 36 and change the current country to whichever country you want.
